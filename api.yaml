  ## What is MQTT?

  ```
  MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely
  simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices
  and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. The design principles
  are to minimise network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also
  attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.
  These principles also turn out to make the protocol ideal of the emerging
  “machine-to-machine” (M2M) or “Internet of Things” world of connected devices,
  and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.
